The Kanban project is a full-stack application built using React, Tailwind, Node.js, and Redux Toolkit. The project allows users to create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks, as well as mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns. Additionally, the app offers form validations when creating and editing boards and tasks and supports the ability to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column.

The app's design is optimized to display correctly on various screen sizes and includes hover states for all interactive elements. Users can toggle between light and dark themes, and there is an option to hide/show the board sidebar.

As a bonus feature, the app keeps track of any changes made, even after refreshing the browser, using localStorage. The app could also be built as a full-stack application.
